TODO: whenever it's Shape.new, it meant Flash.Display.Shape and NOT my Shape. Should convert Shape to ShapeDefinition to avoid ambiguity and then figure out what the heck to do about Shape


TODO: purge everything in Symbol.hx -- it's just an enum for checking symbol types
just use ruby's .is_a?
--it seems as though the types are definition types (i.e. MovieClipDefinition), maybe not the display classes

All the drawing commands are implemented with procs... i.e.

  Proc.new{ |graphics| graphics.move_to(x,y) }
  
This should allow for swapping in any rendering engine.



No plan yet on how to replace the display tree (mostly focused on drawing right now), so here are some worries:
  MorphObject is supposed to extend Sprite (but I have no Sprite yet)
  MorphObject is supposed to have a graphics object (a la Sprite, I assume)
  
  MovieClip is supposed to extend Sprite (and have a graphics object)
  

MovieClip makes use of ENTER_FRAME events for playing... need to figure out how to do that one
MovieClip calls add_child and remove_child...
StaticText needs to render
Sprite needs to render
Shape needs to render
