All the drawing commands are implemented with procs... i.e.

  Proc.new{ |graphics| graphics.move_to(x,y) }
  
This should allow for swapping in any rendering engine.



No plan yet on how to replace the display tree (mostly focused on drawing right now), so here are some worries:
  MorphObject is supposed to extend Sprite (but I have no Sprite yet)
  MorphObject is supposed to have a graphics object (a la Sprite, I assume)
